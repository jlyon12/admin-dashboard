# Admin Dashboard

This dashboard is the last project found in the Intermediate HTML & CSS section of The Odin Project. The brief can be found<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard"> here</a>.

The primary goal of this project is to use CSS grid to create this layout.

Currently this is only optimized for the desktop with large resolutions. I will be adding mobile responsiveness to this project and several features that utilize JavaScript.
